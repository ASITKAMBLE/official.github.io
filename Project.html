                    In my projects I work on 3D mechanical CAD 
                    (computer-aideddesign) program that runs on 
                    Microsoft Windows. In 3D modeling we can easily
                    visualized the imagination and get same results
                    from real world components.
                    


                    Basically I worked on Solidworks and Autodesk Fusion 360 
                    because its provide solid modeler, and utilizes a
                    parametric feature based approach which was initially
                    developed by PTC(Creo/Pro-Engineer) to create models
                    and assemblies.

                        <h2>V12 ENGINE</h2>
                        <h3>
                            V12 is an internal combustion engine with 12 cylinders. The engine has six
                            cylinders on each side called banks. The two banks form a "V" shaped angle.
                            In most engines, the two banks are at a 60° angle to each other. All 
                            twelve pistons turn a common crankshaft.[1] It can be powered by different
                            types of fuels, including gasoline, diesel and natural gas.



                            Each cylinder bank is basically a straight-6. This set-up has perfect balance
                            no matter which V angle is used. A V12 engine does not need balance shafts.
                            A V12 angled at 45°, 60°, 120°, or 180° from each other has even firing and 
                            is smoother than a straight-6. This provides a smooth running engine for a 
                            luxury car. In a racing car, the engine can be made much lighter. This 
                            makes the engine more responsive and smoother. In a large heavy-duty engine,
                            a V12 can run slower, and prolonging engine life.
