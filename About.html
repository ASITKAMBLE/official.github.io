                <h2>FSM<span> Internship</span></h2>
                <h3>In this internship I have to performing<br>
                    simulation of industrial robotic arm in<br>
                    welding cell using RoboDk software.<br><br>
                    RoboDk provides more than 200 industrial<br>
                    robotic arm 3d model for performing<br>
                    various operation like welding, pick and<br>
                    place, colour spray,etc. First I have to<br>
                    make CAD model of workpiece by using CAD<br>
                    software. I prefered solidworks and make<br>
                    exhast pipe as a workpiece.
                </h3>
                <h4>
                    For this project I used two robotic arm<br>
                    one for pick and place operation another<br>
                    for welding opeartion. KUKA KR 30 HA and<br>
                    KUKA KR 8 R1420. I have to make workpiece,<br>
                    pallet fixture, earthing wire and end<br>
                    effector which are placed in end of the<br>
                    robotic arm. I used some tools like welding<br>
                    gun, gripper,etc was provided by RoboDk<br>
                    software.<br>
                    The manufacturing of exhaust manifold or<br>
                    exhaust pipe material could be stainless<br> 
                    steel, steel and cast iron.<br><br>
                    â€¢ Cast iron exhaust manifolds, stainless<br>
                    steel cast exhaust manifold has 3<br> 
                    advantages:
                    1. Corrosion resistant<br>
                    2. Light weight, This is because the<br>
                    stainless steel exhaust manifold has<br>
                    a thinner wall thickness.<br>
                    3. Boost engine performance,<br>
                    The stainless steel exhaust manifold<br> 
                    can reduce main exhaust pressure<br>
                    and provide smooth exhaust to the<br>
                    turbine.<br><br>
