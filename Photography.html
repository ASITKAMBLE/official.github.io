                My favorite way to take a break from the screen is to get out on my motorbike,
                preferably for days at a time, with my camera in tow. You can check out the 
                photos and read about these trips on my blog. And you can visit my 
                Instagram account.
                Below you can see a selection of photos from some of my travels. 
                Most of them were shot with a Canon 550D and an EF-S 17-85 mm f/4-5.6 
                IS USM lens. In 2017 I upgraded to a Canon 80D and a better lens, which 
                offers a significantly better picture quality.
